# Penetration Tester Job Role Path

## Introduction

This is the module that you will take when preparing for the CPTS exam. I will include any additional resources and all techniques that I happen to find on the module.

## How to use this

This is meant for personal use so I am not sure if it will be any useful to anyone who comes across this. But I am planning to make a full checklist based on all techniques that I learn through my journey so that I can easily get through the exam.
